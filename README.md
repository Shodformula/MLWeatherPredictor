# Weather Prediction Project

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict weather conditions for a specified date using historical weather data. The model forecasts temperature, visibility, dew point, feels-like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and cloud coverage.

## Project Structure

- `weather_prediction.py`: Main script containing data processing, model training, and prediction logic.
- `1c49662bdedf90e687dfa1c10d60ef08.csv`: Historical weather data file.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes linear regression to predict various weather parameters.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses the data, handles missing values, and extracts relevant features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporates year, month, and day to capture temporal patterns.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts the user to input a date and provides weather predictions for that date.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
